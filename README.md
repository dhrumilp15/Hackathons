# Hackathon Projects

Thanks for looking at some of my first hackathon projects! As my ideas (and expectations) for my hacks evolved, so did their storage space! I've made repositories for each hackathon project, so check them out on my main page [dhrumilp15](https://github.com/dhrumilp15)!

(THacks 2)
My team built a glove to help arthritis patients exercise their joints in a game. I interfaced the arduino and the firebase database
firebase-connection.py : Opens an input channel for the serial output of an Arduino and uploads it to a firebase database. (Interfacing an arudino and a firebase database)

(ToHacks) Web Scraper - Scrapes twitter page for tweets using scrapy

(Hack The Barriers) - Handles interactions between user and event data of website from firebase realtime database, takes input data from website, stores it appropriately in database, as well as retrieves appropriate data for users and events

(Hack The 6ix 2018) Website - Plays two side-by-side synchronized videos on a website
